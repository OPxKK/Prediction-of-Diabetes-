# Prediction-of-Diabetes-

Desription  => 
Diabetes is a type of chronic disease which is more common among the people of all age groups. Predicting this disease at an early stage can help a person to take the necessary accordingly to either prevent the occurences of the disease or control the disease (For people who alreaddy have the disease).

Task =>
1. Prepare the data-set.
2. Build a model which an give high acuray for predicting the disease.

The Project was a task provided from Exposys Data Labs. We used supervised machine learning modules in this project. To complete this project, various data science modules namely

1.) Matplotlib
2.) Seaborn
3.) Pandas

Machine Learning Module => 1.) Sci-kit

Dataset => diabetes.csv (imported from kaggle)

Machine learning modules such as, SVM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression and many others libraries were used to get appropriate conclusions. Every library of machine learning provied us with their own accuray scores on the basis of the training and the testing data.
The Project was further completed along with these names,

1.) Sneha Sable
2.) Dhanraj Shetty
3.) Samuel Robert

THe IDE used in this project was Jupyter Notebook (Python).
