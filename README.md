# Prediction-of-Diabetes-

The Project was a task rpovided from Exposys Data Labs. We used supervised machine learning modules in this project. To complete this project, various data science modules namely

1.) Matplotlib
2.) Seaborn
3.) Pandas

Machine learning modules such as, SVM, XGBoost, Logistic Regression and many others libraries were used to get appropriate conclusions. Every library of machine learning provied us with their own accuray scores on the basis of the training and the testing data.
The Project was further completed along with these names,

1.) Sneha Sable
2.) Dhanraj Shetty

THe IDE used in this project was Jupyter Notebook (Python).
